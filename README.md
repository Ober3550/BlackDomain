### Blurb
The Conjoiners have been running from the Wolves for the past thousand years. They received knowledge from the last light of humanity of a way that the Wolves can be eliminated for good. Putting the travelling hive at risk isn't an option so a small team of would be colonists travel to the centre of the Milky Way to unleash the weapon on the genocidal Wolves. They must be especially careful of the darkness.

## Chapter One

Galiana, a tall slender woman stood at the front of the classroom, her horn like augment on her forehead pulsed with splashes of colours. "As you should know the Wolves are attracted to any kind of technological indicator. You must keep your colony under complete radio silence so no sending messages back to your parents in the hive. All heavy industry must be suitably deep under the planets crust so as to not emit radiation out where the Wolves can see you. Even after many generations the Wolves will still be out there so just find a way to live a good life." Joseph sat at the back of the classroom his best friend Matt was beside him as he spoke quietly across the desk "Why are we even considering colonisation when we're at war?" Matt leant over to listen and respond to his friend "It doesn't make sense, are the Conjoiners - the most powerful civilisation we know of- expected to cower and hide from now until the end of time?" "Boys" Galiana announced dragging their attention back to her droning "If you've got something to say how about you share it with everyone here? Even if you aren't part of the shared consciousness surely you can still share with the class verbally". "We can't hide or run forever" Joseph spoke up looking straight at his teacher "At our current speed the hive won't be caught for another hundred thousand years" Galiana retorted failing to mention that after all those years they would be flung out into deep space beyond the comfort of the Milky Way "And the colonists?" Joseph watched her knowing the foregone conclusion for them "Our colonies will end up in the same situation as the primary hive, constantly trying to run from a long line of Wolves at our tail". Joseph sat slouched in his chair his arms crossed defiantly unwilling to be sent down to live under a rock for the rest of his life when the hive had the labs and the technology to actually test on the Wolves. "Well Joseph what do you suggest?" he scoffed and shook his head "I think the line of logic is obvious, we should be developing a weapon that can actually destroy them." Galiana's eyes rolled back a little distracted by information floating through her mind "You're an expert on Conjoiner drives" she looked at him thinking for a moment "We may have a program that suits you more than the colonist initiative. Class dismissed". Twenty other students stood and walked out of the classroom as Joseph and Matt stepped forward curious about what this initiative was "Recently we received a message from some humans". "They're alive?" Joseph asked astonished. Galiana responded "They were a hundred years ago. Light takes a while to travel remember. Anyways, the humans gave us information that we could use gravitational waves to disrupt the field that keeps wolves together. I'm not sure about the practicality of that but I'm sure you could shed some light on that topic Joseph" she looked at the man and across to his friend. Matt smiled sheepishly and raised his hand "Matt, I've been in the class for a while and want to join Joseph in this program. I'm an engineer, he has the ideas and I put them into practice". "Right" Galiana nodded slightly "Anyways, the lab is located on planet beta, I can have a transfer ready for you in the morning" "Thankyou" she stood there in mild frustration looking at the young men "Please leave my classroom" "Yes Mam" the boys nodded and stepped outside into the mild orange light. It was mid afternoon and they looked out across to the horizon and saw the teardrop of their sun off in the distance trying to make out a glint of planet beta. Matt gave Joseph an excited smile raising his hand for a fist bump "To not living under a rock" Joseph laughed and met the fist "To fighting back".
