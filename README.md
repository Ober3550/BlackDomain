## Chapter 1

Galiana, a short slender woman with grey hair stood in front of a class of 20 with ages varying from 18 to 32. Her face was expressionless, however the horn protruding from her forehead splashed and danced with colours of red, green, blue and yellow. Thoughts and emotions from the hive flowed in and out of her mind. Despite the numerous distractions she dedicated her voice to teaching the class "Four hundred years ago, as humanity was colonising the first systems we came across the relics of an alien race, the Amarantin. Their home world was destroyed a million years prior while the last surviving traces hid themselves in the computational matrix of a neutron star. They gave us a warning about the wolves - a self-replicating robotic race that lurked in the shadows of our galaxy hell bent on destroying all life. No negotiations were made as the wolves approached the newly human settled Amarantin system and constructed a weapon - a weapon capable of magnetically drilling to the core of a star and exposing the nuclear flames directly across the system sterilising all inhabitants. A hundred years after those events our collective decided to create this hive, a ship capable of travelling fast enough to outrun the wolves and spread pockets of life across the Milky Way in hopes that the battle of progeny and attrition would pay off. You, the students of the 5th colony will be one of those seeds." A boy of about 22 raised his hand, he had blue eyes and brown hair with a streak of grey across his forehead. "Yes?" Galiana's eyes met his own "I understand it's been 400 years... but have we really exhausted every option of fighting back?" She took a moment to respond recalling all the failed attempts of other colonies, hearing the screams of millions of lives being snuffed. "Energy weapons don't really affect them, and the problem isn't each individual bot, the problem is that there a trillions of them, no matter how many you destroy it only takes one to hide away and exponentially grow to a force that can destroy planets and stars once again." The boy hummed and nodded thinking for a moment "Are we aware of any control signals that they use to communicate?" "Not in the electromagnetic range unfortunately". Galiana's answer was a lie of omission. She brought up the boys file in her mind - Joseph, expert in micro black holes and spatial anomalies. She pondered in her mind about inviting him to the project then continued the class "As you should know the Wolves are attracted to any kind of technological indicator. You must keep your colony under complete radio silence so no sending messages back to your parents in the hive. All heavy industry must be suitably deep under the planets crust. Even after many generations the Wolves will still be out there so just find a way to live a good life." Joseph slumped in his chair as Galiana explained the exciting prospect of living under a rock. He leant over chatting to Matt about their project, "Do you think we can steal enough energy to succeed with our experiment?" Matt pursed his lips, his eyes a deep brown looking back at Joseph "Not sure she would be too impressed by us using the university resources for it" he tilted his head indicating toward Galiana. Joseph sat back and sighed looking up at the mural of the Milky way painted on the ceiling. Most of the stars were faint luminescent phosphors except for a single LED in a long line across the disc which indicated the current location of the hive. "Eh fuck it let's go for it" Joseph gave Matt a smile as the sound of an old bell rang out over the class speakers. Joseph stood and walked with Matt from the classroom out along the footpaths of the old university. The buildings were shaped with the architecture across a thousand years of human history, Victorian, Roman, Brutalist and others. The university was rather large as to sustain a colony indefinitely needed expertise in all areas. Joseph and Matt walked past the central cafeteria grabbing a few snacks before heading to a squat building beside the central substation for the campus. They had large aluminium connections into the building, once they stepped inside there was a railgun from wall to wall. On one side was the coils for accelerating the payload and on the other end were the small detector wires around the experimental observation point. Matt sat down behind a computer and started configuring the device, adjusting the energy levels and turning on the observation device. Joseph walked into the room and checked for any contaminants from previous low power tests as well as prepped the target and chambered the compressive pellet.
